**What is a protocol stack, and how is it used in web development?**

A protocol stack is a specific set of rules that defines what kind of protocols need to be followed
to execute a perticular network request on the internet. 

In the context of web development, refers to a set of communication protocols and standards organized
in a layered structure. It is used to facilitate data exchange and communication between different
components of a web application or between a client and a server. 
In web development, the primary protocol stack used is the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/
Internet Protocol) stack, which underlies the entire Internet. It includes protocols like HTTP 
(Hypertext Transfer Protocol), DNS (Domain Name System), and others that enable the functioning of
 the World Wide Web

**What is scaling, and why is it important for web applications? How does scaling differ for vertical and horizontal scaling?**

Scaling in web applications refers to the process of increasing the system's capacity to handle more
users, traffic, or data. It's essential to ensure that a web application remains responsive and
available, especially during traffic spikes. Scaling can be achieved through vertical scaling
(scaling up) and horizontal scaling (scaling out):

Vertical Scaling: Involves increasing the capacity of a single server by adding more resources (eg:
CPU, RAM). It's suitable for applications with a moderate load.
Horizontal Scaling: Involves adding more server instances to distribute the load. It's suitable for
applications with high scalability needs and is often used in cloud-based environments. Load
balancers are commonly employed to distribute traffic across these instances.
