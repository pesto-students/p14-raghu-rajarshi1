    <h2>Location</h2>

      Mysore, officially named Mysuru, lies in the foothills of the Western
      Ghats in the southern state of Karnataka, India. Historically, it was a
      pivotal center of the region, often serving as the capital of the Mysore
      Princely State. The city enjoys a moderate climate and is strategically
      positioned between major Indian cities, making it a critical junction for
      trade, commerce, and culture.

      Mysore's historical significance is palpable with its palaces, fortresses,
      and temples. The city was the epicenter of the Kingdom of Mysore, ruled by
      the Wodeyar dynasty for centuries. Legends of brave kings, dramatic
      battles, and grand alliances intertwine with the very fabric of Mysore,
      giving it a uniquely regal aura. Over time, the city has retained its
